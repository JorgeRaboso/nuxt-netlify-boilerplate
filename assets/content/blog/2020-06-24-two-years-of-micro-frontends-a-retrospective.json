  "description": "We’ve now been using micro-frontends for two years at Beamery. In May 2018 we wrote a post announcing to the world that we’d solved our legacy application problem.",
  "body": "# Divergence\n\nThe speed at which we could create new applications meant that we delivered most new product features as new micro-frontend applications. Every new micro-frontend was delivered with React, but that was where the similarities ended.\n\nMicro-frontends allowed teams and individuals to experiment. Our engineers loved the freedom to try new technologies regularly. However, as a rapidly growing startup, we didn’t manage this well.\n\nFrom code-style and application architecture, through to user experience, our applications were diverging. We built a component library in an attempt to introduce standardisation and code sharing, but without clear ownership, that project encountered problems of its own.",
