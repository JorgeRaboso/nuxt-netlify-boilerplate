  "body": "This folder structure breaks down the store into modules with each of the modules having its own separate folder. The modules folder is positioned in the same folder as the index.js generated by vuex . As expected the content of the index.js file has to change too. e.g:\n\nIn this example I created a module named “user”, I imported it into the index.js file provided by vuex. This way the user module has been connected to the store and can now be accessed.\n\nMoving on to the “user” module we would be importing state, actions, getters, and mutations into the index.js file in this manner:",
